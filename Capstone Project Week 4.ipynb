According to the 2019 United States Census, the Bay Area has over 7.7 million of population. The Bay Area is considered one of the most populous metropolitan areas in California, with many giant IT companies like Google, Facebook, Apple headquartered in the region.\n\nThe Bay Area consists of 9 counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma) and 101 cities. The exact city that I currently reside is Fremont of the Alameda county. As of the 2019 Census, the county had a population of over 1.6 million, making it the 7th-most populous county in California and 20th most populous nationally. The population of Alameda county has been growing over the last five years, primarily driven by a booming economy and import of skilled immigrants in the area. With these, the Alameda county is one of the attractive locations to start a restaurant business.\n\nThe objective of this project is to use data science knowledge acquired from this course and utilize appropriate data science tools to figure out where it would be a best place to open a restaurant in the Alameda county."
